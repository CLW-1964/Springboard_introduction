# Biography

Hello everyone! My name is Chris. I'm a seasoned engineer and problem solver with a very diverse background in Quality Assurance, Yield Enhancement, Logistics, Failure Analysis, Statistical Process Control (SPC), Lean and Six Sigma, MEMS, and most recently Chemical Process and Packaging.

I took a break from the "real" world a couple of years ago to establish manufacturing operations for my family business here in Texas. Now that things are running smoothly, I decided it was time for a change... and here I am!

# What I hope to gain from this course

Three things I hope to gain from this course are:

1. Become quasi-compitent coding in R
2. Brush up on statistics
3. Get better insight into the direction I want to take in data science

# What challenges I anticipate facing

Learning to code! I simply have zero experience doing it.

# What strategies I will use to overcome these challenges

I've been very fortunate in my professional career and have decided to take a one year sabbatical from working in order to achieve my goal of becoming a data scientist. I'm renting a workspace a couple of miles from the house and put in 6+ hours studying Monday through Friday. 

# My capstone project ideas

In no particular order, here are a few ideas I have been kicking around:

* Anything football (soccer) related!
    + Are there factors that can accurately identify which team will win a given match? Does a teams time of possesion matter, team passing accuracy, etc.. Or, is more individul player related? Could we predict the winner of the World Cup using a team's individual player stats from their club team?
* Healthcare treatment outcomes
    + based upon a diagnosis can we determine an optimal course of treatment? My guess is we can, but for a first project I will probably have to narrow the focus.
* The 2016 and future US elections
    + Is there a way to determine if outside (Russian) factors influenced certain segments of the population to vote one way or the other? Can we predict future election results based on shifting population demographics?
