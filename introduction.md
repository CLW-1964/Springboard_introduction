# Biography

Hi everyone. My name is Guy. I have a background in algorithm development for
Radar and Raman spectroscopy. It was my PhD in statistical pattern recognition
that got me into this field, if you can call it a field, that mixes programming
with science and domain knowledge and more than a little hacking. I enjoy running
for keeping fit and have a pet house rabbit.

# What I hope to gain from this course

Three things I hope to gain from this course are:

1. Helping others to learn new skills
2. Editing an enumerated list in markdown

# What challenges I anticipate facing

I am very busy and time is very precious. It is going to be very
hard finding the time to keep up my running after work and studying.

# What strategies I will use to overcome these challenges

I will establish a set routine of going for a run as soon as I get home
from work, for an hour. That gives me an hour for dinner and then two
hours to devote to studying. This core of 10 hours in the working week
can be supplemented by time at the weekend. I will not watch TV during
the week.

# My capstone project ideas

Some questions on my mind at the moment include:

* Can historic house prices reveal gentrification waves?
* Is gentrification associated with increased homelessness?
* When is the best time to donate to homeless causes?

My thinking here is that historic house price data is readily available, but
a key question is how to define, and thus detect, gentrification. How would I best
divide the spatial data into regions? Assuming gentrification can be defined/detected,
can I obtain matching (regional) data on homelessness? I believe this is notoriously
underreported. This may be a problem for that question. For the final question, I will
look at homeless charities and see if they publish any data. My starting assumption is
that Christmas is a popular time for goodwill, with Christmas dinners provided in various
locations and shelters opening their doors. But what about the cold months after? Does the
surge of goodwill and public attention drop, leaving the homeless literally out in the cold?
Will I need some sort of supply and demand data from a charity?
